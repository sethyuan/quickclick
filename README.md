# quickclick

A simple heuristic to ensure quick click events on mobile browsers.

## Quick Start

In a CommonJS environment, you can use it this way:

```js
var QuickClick = require("quickclick");

// Pass in the root element where quick clicks are scoped.
QuickClick(document.body);
```

A global `QuickClick` is offered otherwise, and you can use it like this:

```js
// Pass in the root element where quick clicks are scoped.
QuickClick(document.body);
```
